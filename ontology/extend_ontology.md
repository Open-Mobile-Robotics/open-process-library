To create additional namespaces for process automation type entities in the Digital Buildings Ontology, you need to follow a structured approach for defining and integrating these entities into the existing ontology. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Adding Process Automation Namespaces

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Start by cloning the Digital Buildings repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/google/digitalbuildings.git
   cd digitalbuildings
   ```

2. **Understand the Existing Ontology Structure:**
   Review the existing ontology files to understand the structure and naming conventions. Pay particular attention to the `ontology` folder, which contains the definitions.
   ```bash
   cd ontology
   ```

3. **Define New Namespaces:**
   Create new YAML files for your process automation entities. These should follow the existing format used in the ontology. Here is a template for a new namespace:

   ```yaml
   namespace: process_automation
   entities:
     - name: ProcessController
       description: "A device that controls the automation of industrial processes."
       fields:
         - name: control_mode
           type: string
           description: "The mode of operation for the process controller."
         - name: set_point
           type: float
           unit: "degree_celsius"
           description: "The desired set point for the process."
         - name: output_signal
           type: float
           unit: "percentage"
           description: "The output signal sent to the actuators."
   ```

4. **Extend Existing Types if Necessary:**
   If your new entities extend existing types, ensure you reference those correctly. This promotes reuse and consistency within the ontology.

   ```yaml
   entities:
     - name: ProcessSensor
       extends: Sensor
       description: "A sensor used in process automation systems."
       fields:
         - name: measurement_type
           type: string
           description: "Type of measurement (e.g., temperature, pressure)."
   ```

5. **Update the Ontology Index:**
   Make sure to include your new namespaces and entities in the ontology index file to ensure they are recognized by the validation and other tools.

   ```yaml
   includes:
     - file: process_automation/ProcessController.yaml
     - file: process_automation/ProcessSensor.yaml
   ```

6. **Validate Your Changes:**
   Use the ontology validation tools provided in the repository to ensure your changes are correct and do not break the existing ontology.

   ```bash
   python tools/ontology_validator.py --ontology_file=ontology.yaml
   ```

7. **Commit and Push Your Changes:**
   After validating your changes, commit them to your local repository and push them to your fork or branch.

   ```bash
   git add ontology/
   git commit -m "Added process automation namespaces"
   git push origin your-branch
   ```

8. **Create a Pull Request:**
   Finally, create a pull request on the main repository to merge your changes. Provide a detailed description of the new namespaces and their purpose.

### Example Namespaces for Process Automation

Here are some example entities you might consider for process automation:

- **ProcessController:** Manages the control of various processes.
- **ProcessSensor:** Collects data from the process environment.
- **Actuator:** Executes commands from the controller to adjust the process.
- **PLC (Programmable Logic Controller):** A digital computer used for automation of industrial processes.

### Example YAML for Process Automation

**ProcessController.yaml**
```yaml
namespace: process_automation
entities:
  - name: ProcessController
    description: "A device that controls the automation of industrial processes."
    fields:
      - name: control_mode
        type: string
        description: "The mode of operation for the process controller."
      - name: set_point
        type: float
        unit: "degree_celsius"
        description: "The desired set point for the process."
      - name: output_signal
        type: float
        unit: "percentage"
        description: "The output signal sent to the actuators."
```

**ProcessSensor.yaml**
```yaml
namespace: process_automation
entities:
  - name: ProcessSensor
    description: "A sensor used in process automation systems."
    fields:
      - name: measurement_type
        type: string
        description: "Type of measurement (e.g., temperature, pressure)."
      - name: value
        type: float
        unit: "unit_dependent"
        description: "The measured value."
```
