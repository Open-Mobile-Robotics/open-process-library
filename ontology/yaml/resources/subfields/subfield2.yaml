In the context of the Open Process Library ontology and MTP (Modular Type Package), concepts like feedback, current, request, vmin, vmax, etc., would be considered point types or subfields that describe the specific functions and states of the equipment and processes. Here is how these concepts can be integrated into the `subfields.yaml` file:
