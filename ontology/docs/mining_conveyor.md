# Burroughs Mining Conveyor Belt Control

This document outlines the best practices for modeling the Conveyor Belt Control system at the Burroughs Mining Station using the Open Process Library standards. The goal is to provide a clear, consistent approach for representing the control and monitoring of conveyor belt operations.

  * [Multi-Conveyor Belt System](#example-multi-conveyor-belt-system)

## Type Definition
Conveyor belts are essential components in mining operations, used for transporting mined materials. They typically include components like motors, speed sensors, and controllers to ensure efficient and safe operation.

## Type Requirements
- It **must** have a motor for moving the belt.
- It **must** monitor and control the belt speed.
- It **must** provide feedback on the operational status.
- It **must** handle commands to start and stop the motor.

## Connection Requirements
- The equipment which is part of each system should be assigned a `HAS_PART` connection to it.
- The specific interconnections between equipment in the system can also be defined through `FEEDS` connections.

## Example: Single Conveyor Belt System
This version of a conveyor belt operates as a stand-alone device in a mining operation.

### Sample Configuration
```yaml
BURR_MH:
  type: FACILITIES/MATERIAL_HANDLING

CONV_BELT_1:
  pol_device_id: 1234
  connections:
    BURR_MH: HAS_PART
  type: MINING/CONV_BELT
  translation:
    speed_sensor_feedback:
      present_value: points.speed_sensor.present_value
      units:
        key: pointset.points.speed_sensor.units
        values:
          meters_per_second: m/s
    motor_command_start:
      present_value: points.motor_start_command.present_value
      units:
        key: pointset.points.motor_start_command.units
        values:
          boolean: bool
    controller_status_feedback:
      present_value: points.controller_status.present_value
      units:
        key: pointset.points.controller_status.units
        values:
          status: st
    ...

```

## Example: Multi-Conveyor Belt System
This setup includes multiple conveyor belts operating within the same material handling system, coordinated for efficiency and safety.

## Optional and Future Extensions
This section contains additional features and extensions that could be added in the future.
- Advanced monitoring capabilities for predictive maintenance.
- Integration with other material handling systems for enhanced automation.
- Adding more detailed control options for complex conveyor operations.
