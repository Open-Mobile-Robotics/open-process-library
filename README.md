## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following software and tools installed:

- A compatible PLC programming environment (e.g., Siemens TIA Portal, Rockwell Studio 5000, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of PLC programming and process automation principles

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/open-mobile-robotics/Open-Process-Library.git
   ```
2. **Import the Library**:
   - Follow the instructions specific to your PLC programming environment to import the library components into your project.

### Usage

1. **Browse the Library**:
   - Explore the various function blocks, data types, and example programs provided in the library.
2. **Integrate Components**:
   - Select and integrate the relevant components into your PLC program as needed.
3. **Customize and Extend**:
   - Modify and extend the components to suit your specific application requirements.

### Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use a function block from the Open Process Library in your PLC program:

```plaintext
(* Example of using a pump control function block *)
PROGRAM PumpControl
VAR
    Pump: FB_PumpControl;
    StartButton: BOOL;
    StopButton: BOOL;
    IsRunning: BOOL;
END_VAR

(* Main program *)
IF StartButton THEN
    Pump.Start();
ELSIF StopButton THEN
    Pump.Stop();
END_IF;

IsRunning := Pump.IsRunning();
```
